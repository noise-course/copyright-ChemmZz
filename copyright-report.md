#### 1. Platform Copyright Policy Analysis
For the assignment the platform I chose was TikTok

- **How does the platform detect copyrighted content? (automated systems like Content ID, manual reporting, etc.)**

    Users that believe their copyright has been infringed can manually submit a Copyright Infringement Report to request the removal of the alleged infringing content from TikTok through an online form ([TikTok Copyright Guide](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/copyright)).

    Although I did not find any mention of this in the official documentation, webpages like CapCut and Screenapp mention the use of automated systems, more specifically using Content ID to instantly detect copyright infringements ([Screenapp - How to Check Copyright Video Before Uploading on TikTok: Complete 2025 Guide](https://screenapp.io/blog/how-to-check-copyright-video-before-uploading-on-tiktok)) ([CapCut - How to Avoid TikTok Copyright: Stay Safe from Flags and Mutes](https://www.capcut.com/resource/tiktok-copyright#How%20to%20detect%20TikTok%20copyright%3A%20In-app%20setting)).

- **What happens when content is flagged as potentially infringing?**
    
    Again, I did not find direct mention of this in TikTok's official documentation but a post in Wondershare ([How to Check TikTok Video Copyright Before Posting: A Step-by-Step Guide](https://filmora.wondershare.com/tiktok/check-tiktok-video-copyright-before-uploading.html)) mentions that if Content ID detects a copyright infringement the platform mutes the video or takes it down entirely. In cases where the copyright infringement happens in the preprocessing of the media, TikTok would even prevent it from uploading.

    On the official TikTok guidelines ([TikTok Copyright Guidelines](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/copyright)) mentions that after a manual Copyright Infringement Report an Intellectual Property (IP) specialist will review the case and reach a verdict. If the IP specialist does find an infringement they will take down the content and notify both reporter and reported person.

    Each binding copyright infringment is marked as a strike. If the user has 3 strikes the account will permanently removed.


- **What is the appeals or counter-notification process?**

    After the notification to both parties, the reported person can appeal by going to a provided link in the notification, fill all the required information, including contact information and prove to support the claim that the user is authorized to use the copyrighted material or that the user has the right to use the content ([TikTok Copyright Guidelines](https://support.tiktok.com/en/safety-hc/account-and-user-safety/copyright)).

- **How does the platform handle monetization of content containing copyrighted material?**
    According to the [Creator Rewards Program Guideline](https://support.tiktok.com/en/business-and-creator/creator-rewards-program/creator-rewards-program) content that has copyright material is not eligible to be monetized. 


- **Are there any special programs (e.g., YouTube's Content ID licensing agreements)?**

    TikTok has licensing and agreements with major music right holders like the
    Commercial Music Library (CML) where users have access with a pre-cleaned music library featuring content that has licensing partnerships with TikTok, making it risk-free to use this content ([Turning up the volume on the TikTok Commercial Music Library with the Artist Impact Program](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/commercial-music-library?lang=en)).


Compare the platform's stated policy with the behavior you observe in your experiments (Tasks 2 and 3).

#### 2. Fair Use Experiments

- **Raw copyrighted clip** I used a fight scene of the movie Superman (2025) that includes copyrighted music. So in this case is both the audio and the video that are copytright infringement
